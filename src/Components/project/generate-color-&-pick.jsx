            When you visit the site, you're greeted with a clean and intuitive interface. The core feature is a "Generate Color" buttonâ€”clicking it instantly changes the box's color to a randomly generated color and displays its hex and rgb code in input field (e.g., <span style={{backgroundColor: '#f1c40f'}}>#f1c40f</span>). Next to the codes, there is a "Copy" button, which copies the code to your clipboard with a single click, complete with a brief "Copied!" confirmation, and a "Save" button, which saves the code to custom color preset. This simplicity makes it a handy tool for designers and developers needing quick color inspiration or codes for their projects.
